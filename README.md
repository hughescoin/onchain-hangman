## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Base compatible wallet (Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask, etc.)
- At least .0001 ETH on Base Sepolia

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd hangman-onchain
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```env
CDP_API_KEY_ID=your_cdp_api_key_id
CDP_API_KEY_SECRET=your_cdp_api_key_secret
CDP_WALLET_SECRET=your_cdp_wallet_secret
CDP_SIGNER_ADDRESS=your_cdp_signer_address
GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA=your_game_contract_address
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üìù Smart Contract

The game uses a smart contract deployed on Base network that handles:

- Game entry fees
- Reward distribution
- Win recording
- Owner controls for fee management

### Contract Addresses

- Base Sepolia: [0x7eFc99DF7e8a2b01E2E3d905c37e45F8d3FB227F](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x7eFc99DF7e8a2b01E2E3d905c37e45F8d3FB227F#code)

### Contract Functions

- `startGame(bool payWithETH)`: Start a new game
- `recordReward(address player, bool isETH)`: Record a player's win
- `setEntryFee(bool isETH, uint256 newFee)`: Update entry fees (owner only)
- `setEthPayoutAmount(uint256 newAmount)`: Update ETH rewards (owner only)
- `setUsdcPayoutAmount(uint256 newAmount)`: Update USDC rewards (owner only)

## üîÑ Deploying Your Own Version

1. The smart contract is verified on Base network
2. Deploy using Foundry or Remix
3. Update the contract address in your environment variables
4. Change the owner address to your server wallet address to use `onlyOwner` functions

## Onchain Win Recording

When a user wins, their address is recorded onchain via the `/api/win` endpoint using a Coinbase CDP account. See `RrcordOnchainSteps.md` for details. You must set the following in your `.env.local`:

- CDP_API_KEY_ID
- CDP_API_KEY_SECRET
- CDP_WALLET_SECRET
- CDP_SIGNER_ADDRESS
